**Lemon AI​** is the first **​full-stack, open-source, agentic AI framework**, offering a **​fully local alternative​** to platforms like **Manus & Genspark AI. It features an integrated Code Interpreter VM sandbox for safe execution**.​​

**​Lemon AI empowers deep research, web browsing, viable coding, and data analysis – running entirely on your local hardware.​​** It supports ​**planning, action, reflection, and memory​** functionalities using **​local LLMs**​ (like DeepSeek, Qwen, Llama, Gemma) via **Ollama**, ensuring **​complete privacy and zero cloud dependency.**

For enhanced security, Lemon AI operates within a ​**local Virtual Machine (VM) sandbox.** This sandbox **​protects your machine's files and operating system​** by safely handling all code writing, execution, and editing tasks.

Additionally, Lemon AI provides the **​flexibility to configure enhanced results**​ using APIs from leading cloud models like **​Claude, GPT, Gemini, and Grok.**

### function and characteristic

#### Complex Task Solving
Lemon is capable of solving a wide range of complex and dynamic tasks, including but not limited to market research, document processing, travel planning, and data analysis. Through independent thinking and systematic planning, it can flexibly utilize various tools in the virtual environment—such as writing and executing code, intelligently browsing web pages, and operating web applications.

#### Autonomy and Goal Orientation
Lemon possesses a high degree of autonomy and can complete tasks independently without human intervention. It is able to perceive, reason, make decisions, and act based on predefined objectives.

#### Real-Time Task Monitoring
Users can monitor the execution status of tasks in real time through the page sidebar.

#### Multi-Scenario Coverage
Lemon is designed to handle complex tasks across multiple domains, including market research, financial analysis, data analysis, code programming, life planning, and more.

#### Self-Subscription Mode
In addition to the default model, Lemon supports user-defined model integration and online model access. These models can be used by configuring the model API.
